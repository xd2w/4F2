# 4F2 Robust and non-linear control coursework
CW1 - plant with uncertainty simulated in MATLAB and controlled using $H_2$ and $H_\infty$ control by finding a state-feedback controller that guarentees centrain performance (bounded gain and stability respectively).

CW2 - Roboust control explained as above but with plant with non-linearlity.

* The Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) is used to constraint the feedback controller and solved using convex optimisation usign CVX.
